# TypeClear Accessibility

Last updated: February 12, 2026

TypeClear is designed so users with different visual, cognitive, and motor needs can complete common app tasks: start a session, type a lesson, review progress, change settings, and export results.

## Supported accessibility features

### VoiceOver
- The interface includes semantic labels and a screen-reader-friendly structure.
- Core controls (top actions, options panel, typing field, and dialogs) are announced correctly by VoiceOver.

### Voice Control
- The app uses standard system controls (buttons, lists, switches, sliders, and text fields), compatible with Apple Voice Control commands.
- Interactive elements include clear labels to improve voice-driven actions.

### Dark Interface
- TypeClear provides dark and high-contrast themes that can be used for both training and navigation.

### Differentiate Without Color
- Typing states are not conveyed by color alone.
- In addition to color, the app uses visual cues such as active-cursor underline, error strike-through/styling, and typographic changes for correct input.

### Sufficient Contrast
- High-contrast and vision-friendly themes are available.
- The UI prioritizes readability of text, iconography, and key controls.

### Reduce Motion
- TypeClear includes a built-in “Reduce Motion” option.
- The app also respects system accessibility preferences for reduced animation/navigation effects.

### Captions
- Text-to-speech (TTS) can display live captions for currently spoken content.

### Audio Descriptions
- The app can narrate important training events (diagnostic start/cancel, guided breaks, and end-of-session summaries).
